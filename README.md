# recipe-project
This is a simple HTML project built as part of the Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum. The goal was to create a recipe webpage that meets specific accessibility and semantic HTML standards. The page includes a recipe title, introduction, ingredients list, step-by-step instructions, and an image of the dish.
